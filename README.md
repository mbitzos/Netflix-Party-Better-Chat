# Netflix Party Better Chat
Google Chrome extension that makes Netflix Party chat sidebar easier to show/hide.

Literally just adds a toggle chat button. Thats it.

When hidden, it will fade away with the rest of the Netflix UI so that its only visible when it needs to be.


**NOTE: Not affiliated with Netflix/Netflix Party, not an official Extension**

_This isn't on the Google Extension store because I did not want to pay 25$ for this_
